<!-- ## Unreleased -->

## [0.6.1] - 2018-09-17

### Fixed
* Fixes part rendering and css custom properties issues introduced with lit-html 0.11.3 by updating to 0.11.4 (https://github.com/Polymer/lit-element/issues/202).

### Removed
* Removed custom_typings for Polymer as they are no longer needed
(https://github.com/Polymer/lit-element/issues/186).

## [0.6.0] - 2018-09-13

### Added
* Added `@query()`, `@queryAll()`, and `@customElement` decorators ([#159](https://github.com/Polymer/lit-element/pull/159))

### Changed
* Significantly changed update/render lifecycle and property API. Render lifecycle
is now `requestUpdate`, `shouldUpdate`, `update`, `render`, `firstUpdated`
(first time only), `updated`, `updateComplete`. Property options are now
`{attribute, reflect, type, hasChanged}`. Properties may be defined in a
`static get properties` or using the `@property` decorator.
(https://github.com/Polymer/lit-element/pull/132).


### Removed
* Removed render helpers `classString` and `styleString`. Similar directives
(`classMap` and `styleMap`) have been added to lit-html and should be used instead
(https://github.com/Polymer/lit-element/pull/165 and
https://github.com/Polymer/lit-html/pull/486).

### Fixed
* The `npm run checksize` command should now return the correct minified size
(https://github.com/Polymer/lit-element/pull/153).
* The `firstUpdated` method should now always be called the first time the element
updates, even if `shouldUpdate` initially returned `false`
(https://github.com/Polymer/lit-element/pull/173).
